- 👋 Hi, I’m Black-Ice. I have been playing games since I was 4 in 1998, a mega Half-life nerd, and overall chill individual.
  
- 👀 You'll find I am a generic, casual gamer not strictly tied to any specific genre - though my most common are FPS!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently mapping for the source engine, specifically Garrys Mod. I have been doing this since around 2009/2010, but only publishing since around 2015.
  
- 💞️ I'm not looking to collaborate, but if you have an offer, feel free to reach out!
